== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How do I get a Worldwide Express account number? =

Worldwide Express is a US national franchise organization. Check your phone book for local
listings or call its corporate office at 1-800-758-7447 and ask how to contact the sales office serving your area.

You can can request an authentication key by logging into Worldwide Express’s online shipping system ( speedship.wwex.com ) 
and navigating to Services > Web Services. An authentication key will be emailed to you, usually within the hour.

= Why were the shipment charges I received on the invoice from Worldwide Express different than what was quoted by the plugin? =

Common reasons include one of the shipment parameters (weight, dimensions) is different, or additional services (such as residential 
delivery) were required. Compare the details of the invoice to the shipping settings on the products included in the shipment. 
Consider making changes as needed. Remember that the weight of the packing materials is included in the billable weight for the shipment. 
If you are unable to reconcile the differences call your local Worldwide Express office for assistance.

= Why do I sometimes get a message that a shipping rate estimate couldn’t be provided? =

There are several possibilities:

* UPS has restrictions on a shipment’s maximum weight, length and girth which your shipment may have exceeded.
* There wasn’t enough information about the weight or dimensions for the products in the shopping cart to retrieve a shipping rate estimate.
* The Worldwide Express web service isn’t operational.
* Your Worldwide Express account has been suspended or cancelled.
